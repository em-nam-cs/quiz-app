@description: A quiz game that pulls questions and answers
from a pre-defined array and will change the background color
based on if the selected answer is correct or not. The background of
each answer button will display if it is correct or wrong. Loops through the 
questions in a random order. Does not keep score or allow users to change 
answers. After selecting the next button, a new question will be showed.

@prerequisites: color vision to distinguish the red and green backgrounds
which indicate correctness

@future updates:
- score keeping
- keeps track of which number question is being asked
- does not move grid when next btn appears
- remove the hover effect after the answer selected, only allow hover on next btn
- highlight the answer that was chosen
- fix CSS for answer buttons
- end game options and restart mid game
- instructions pop-out
- randomize order of answer options
